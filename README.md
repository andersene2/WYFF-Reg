Overview of JavaScript:
A. JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It is possible to change some HTML and CSS. 
    JS can also create, insert, or predict data. Working with different versions like React helps the developer 
    combine HMTL and JS.
B. Key concepts and features learned during the internship starts from learning the basics of JS at Variable and data types. 
    Like I said this is the most basic of creating data like assigning variable some form of value for example a string, number, or even
    or a function.   
    Learning control flow and loops are also key for becoming an efficient developer. Instead of writing multiple lines of code,
    writing a loop to run through a block of code multiple time helps save time. Using conditionals are helpful to let the 
    computer make decisions when many paths are possible.
    Functions are the most important structure of code. This allows the developer to create a block of code that tells the
    computer to run commands for a certain output. If a developer needs the same block of code later on, instead of writing 
    the same line of code, we can call the function line, which then runs the entire function we created the first time.
    (Also saves time.)

    
Introduciton to React
A. React is a front-end JS library. It relies on the developer making "components" for the website he or she is creating. 
B. A safe reason to say why developers use React is because of their JSX syntax. The JSX syntax is a combination of JS 
    and HTML. It was somewhat easy to get used to, even though some information can be hard to grasp at first. I learned 
    HTML and JS first before learning JSX, therefore I had a smoother transition.
    State management is crucial for React as well. The state management is what lets the computer know that something on
    the website has changed. 

    
Working with Supabase
A. Supabase's role with backend developement is that it provides the developer API generation with instant updates. It also 
    offers database management, and authentication. 
B. The outcome with learning Supabase is still in motion. Setting up the project was a little problematic, although once I 
    got help from John, I realised I was just making a small mistake. Supabase has clear instructions, although it was a new
    experience for me so it took some time.
    Currently I am struggling with connecting my current form with the database I made on Supabase. Although normally I can 
    say that Supabase is helpful, and once working I'm sure I will sound more positive in this section.


WYFF Registration Form Project Highlights
A. The tasks dne to prepare for and complete the work:
  1. Learn HTML
  2. Learn JS
  3. Learn React (up to around chapter 30)
  4. Learn Vite
  5. Learn npm/node.js
  6. Take intro to Supabase
  7. Pray
B. The practical application of JS in the project is using a language usable for front-end and back-end development. It was 
    what I was tasked to code with as well, which made it easy when making/using JSX files. React was very nice because most 
    JSX code is placed in one return statement with a fragment "<> </>". Supabase's application was supposed to be used
    to store the user's information when clicking the "register" button, although currently is it not sending the data.
C. Noteworthy achievments and/or challanges were studying the React projects to the point where I could not use the guides
    or look at the solution before finishing. Helped build my confidence and confirm my knowledge on the tested subjects.
    (As soon as I finish that database and make it work you can bet I am putting that in here.)


Key Takeaways
A. My key learnings from the internship experience was that I was able to work in a somewhat professional enviroment. I
    learned how to code in JS, HTML, and React. I also am learning how to use Supabase which once I efficiently learn
    will be beyond helpful for me and future projects. I feel proficeint in JS, although new developers tend to
    overcomplicate things and write too much code anyways.
    I was able to use React to build a form that lets the user interact with it, and once complete will send their data 
    to a database. Supabase definately helped my understanding of back-end development with its amount of helpful links
    and pages of resources.
    I was working remote so I learned how to communicate more efficiently and in a productive way. I learned that
    coding isn't just rolling the dice when running into a problem. It is breaking down the problem and building a
    plan for each step. Learning how to work long days and running into problems by working remote also made me 
    improvise what I was working on as well so I learned how to properly look up information.


Conclusion
A. To anyone aspiring to become a developer, whether you want to become a front-end or back-end, I was able to work on both.
    You get experience for both sides, and for anyone who doesn't know, don't worry I didn't know either. There were days 
    when I didn't want to code because I knew there was a problem I had to try and fix, although I still did it and came out
    a better developer. This contributed to my personal and professional growth because I genuinely like coding, so this 
    entire time I was enjoying myself while learning a new side of coding. I also learned a lot about how to be professional 
    in a work space with other developers and complete tasks giving on time.

My favorite qoutes from John:
  1. "A programmer is a person who fixed a problem you didn't know you had, in a way you don't understand."
  2. "Programming is easy. It's like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, and you're on fire, and everything is on
    fire because you're in hell."
